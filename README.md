## Problem Description
In today's rapidly evolving automotive landscape, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their economic and environmental benefits. However, with a wide array of EV models available on the market, consumers often struggle to navigate through the plethora of options to find the most economical choice that fits their needs.

To address this challenge, this project aims to develop an end-to-end data pipeline to analyze and visualize data related to the most economical electric vehicles. By leveraging datasets containing comprehensive information about various EV models, including factors such as price, range, efficiency, and charging infrastructure, this project aims to provide actionable insights to consumers, policymakers, and automotive industry stakeholders.

Key Objectives:

ðŸ”´Dataset Selection: The project will begin by selecting a suitable dataset containing detailed information about electric vehicles, such as model specifications, pricing, energy efficiency ratings, charging infrastructure availability, and consumer ratings.

ðŸ”´Data Pipeline Development: A robust data pipeline will be developed to process the selected dataset and store it in a data lake infrastructure. This pipeline will involve data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to ensure data integrity and accessibility.

ðŸ”´Data Warehousing: Subsequently, another pipeline will be constructed to move the processed data from the data lake to a data warehouse. The data warehouse will serve as a centralized repository for storing and querying the EV data, enabling efficient data analysis and reporting.

ðŸ”´Data Transformation: Within the data warehouse, the raw EV data will undergo further transformation and aggregation to prepare it for dashboard visualization. This step may involve data cleansing, normalization, and aggregation to derive meaningful insights and metrics.

ðŸ”´Dashboard Development: Finally, a user-friendly dashboard will be built to visualize the analyzed EV data. The dashboard will include interactive tiles displaying key metrics and visualizations, such as comparative analyses of EV models based on price, range, efficiency, and charging infrastructure availability. Users will be able to explore the data dynamically and gain valuable insights to inform their decision-making processes.

Overall, this project aims to empower consumers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders with comprehensive insights into the most economical electric vehicles, ultimately contributing to the widespread adoption of sustainable transportation solutions and informed decision-making in the automotive sector.
